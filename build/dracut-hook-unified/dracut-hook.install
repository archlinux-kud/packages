dracut-hook-unified doesn't generate fallback initramfs and will never assume
so. Make sure to disable default preset of all installed kernels if you plan to
keep mkinitcpio package around for fallback initramfs.

Depending on how you treat mkinitcpio presets later on, default images created
by mkinitcpio will override those generated by dracut.
